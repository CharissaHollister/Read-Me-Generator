# **Professional *README* Generator**

##### [Github repo source](https://github.com/CharissaHollister/Read-Me-Generator)

## Description:

######  This is a *README* generator built to aid with production of a *README* file within your developed projects that will track and upload from the terminal to the *README* file. The goal of this is to improve communication and to aid with redundancy within a project in order to build professional *README* that can be utilized for navigation within a project and or functional collected data produced by the user.
